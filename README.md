My Code Base for my senior thesis at WashU under Mladen Wickerhauser. 
This repository contains 3 python files:

-The machine learning - based implementation

-The python part of the classical implementation

-The python script to resize images

I've also uploaded the final PDF of my thesis, which is the Friewald Work III pdf file.
